        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><strong>Sweet and Sour Chicken </strong>is a popular <em>Chinese-American </em> dish known for its delicious balance of flavors. The chicken is typically battered and deep-fried until crispy, then tossed in a tangy, vibrant sauce that combines the sweetness of sugar with the tartness of vinegar and ketchup. The sauce is often enhanced with ingredients like soy sauce, garlic, and pineapple, giving it a fresh, fruity taste.</p> 
        <p>The dish is usually served with bell peppers, onions, and sometimes pineapple chunks, which add extra texture and flavor to the dish. The result is a perfect mix of savory, sweet, and sour tastes thatâ€™s both comforting and exciting to the palate. Sweet and sour chicken is often enjoyed with steamed rice and is a staple on Chinese takeout menus.</p>
