        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><strong>Lasagna </strong>is a classic <em>Italian</em> dish made with layers of wide, flat pasta sheets alternated with savory fillings. Traditional versions feature rich meat sauce (like Bolognese), creamy béchamel or ricotta cheese, and melted mozzarella, all baked together to create a hearty, comforting meal. The top layer is typically golden and bubbly, forming a flavorful crust.</p> 
        <p>Lasagna is known for its deliciously layered texture and bold, satisfying flavors, making it a favorite comfort food around the world. Variations may include vegetables, different meats, or alternative sauces, but the layered format remains iconic.</p>
