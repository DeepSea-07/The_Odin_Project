Hello... To whoever is reading this ..

Today is 26th June , 2025 .

So i created this RI website as part of the project that The Odin Project have given me..
I truly enjoyed it.
Even though I am still in flexbox section in Foundation , I truly gave my all..

All the artworks that you will see in my site was drawn by none other that 'Godly OSOT from bilibili.com ' ,
who is single-handedly keeping the fandom alive..

Sorry, but i dont know who voiced the quote of fang yuan , if i ever get to know i will surely credit him .
